1. Create tables
    a. Make a student table
        ANS: 
        CREATE table Student(
            Roll INT PRIMARY KEY,
            Name VARCHAR(48),
            Class VARCHAR(10),
            Section VARCHAR(10)
        );

    b. Make a Library table
        ANS:
        CREATE table Library(
            Hired_by_roll INT,
            Hired_by_Name VARCHAR(48),
            Book_Name VARCHAR(50),
        );

    c. Make a Fees table
        ANS:
        CREATE table Fees(
            Roll INT,
            Name VARCHAR(48),
            Fee_for VARCHAR(50),
            Amount INT
        );

2. Add proper constraints with the No 1 question
    a. Make a student table
        ANS: 
        CREATE table Student(
            Roll INT PRIMARY KEY,
            Name VARCHAR(48) NOT NULL,
            Class VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
            Section VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
        );

    b. Make a Library table
        ANS:
        CREATE table Library(
            Hired_by_roll INT,
            Hired_by_Name VARCHAR(48) NOT NULL,
            Book_Name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            FOREIGN KEY (Hired_by_roll) REFERENCES Student (Roll)
        );

    c. Make a Fees table
        ANS:
        CREATE table Fees(
            Roll INT,
            Name VARCHAR(48) NOT NULL,
            Fee_for VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            Amount INT,
            FOREIGN KEY (Roll) REFERENCES Student (Roll)
        );

3. Write the differences between data and information
    ANS: 
        Data: Any values from information is known as data.
        Information: Collection of data that is well organised and easy to understand known as Information.
    
4. In MySQL, Update and Delete query wasn’t executing, what was the
reason and how to run those query? Write the code to enable the
feature. (If you followed the class, you should know this).
    ANS: 
        We need to write this line -
           => SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
        to of safe update security.
        It is safe to on safe update option after the operation -
           => SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 1;
